          The magic of Serengeti National Park is not easy to describe in words.
          Not only seeing, but also hearing the buzz of millions of wildebeest
          so thick in the air that it vibrates through your entire body is
          something you will try to describe to friends and family, before
          realizing it’s impossible. Vistas of honey-lit plains at sunset so
          beautiful, it’s worth the trip just to witness this. The genuine
          smiles of the Maasai people, giving you an immediate warming glow
          inside. Or just the feeling of constantly being amongst thousands of
          animals – it doesn’t matter what season of the migration you visit the
          Serengeti National Park, it’s magical all year round.

          Serengeti National Park was one of the first sites listed as a World
          Heritage Site when United Nations delegates met in Stockholm in 1981.
          Already by the late 1950s, this area had been recognized as a unique
          ecosystem, providing us with many insights into how the natural world
          functions and showing us how dynamic ecosystems really are. Today,
          most visitors come here with one aim alone: to witness millions of
          wildebeest, zebras, gazelles and elands on a mass trek to quench their
          thirst for water and eat fresh grass. During this great cyclical
          movement, these ungulates move around the ecosystem in a seasonal
          pattern, defined by rainfall and grass nutrients. These large herds of
          animals on the move can’t be witnessed anywhere else. Whereas other
          famous wildlife parks are fenced, the Serengeti is protected, but
          unfenced. Giving animals enough space to make their return journey,
          one that they’ve been doing for millions of years. Read more about the
          Great Migration.
